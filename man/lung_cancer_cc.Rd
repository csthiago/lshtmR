\title{Simulated Case-Control Study Data for Lung Cancer}
\format{
A data frame with 500 rows and 5 variables:
\describe{
\item{id}{Unique participant identifier.}
\item{case}{Case status: 1 = lung cancer case, 0 = control.}
\item{smoking}{Smoking exposure: 1 = smoker, 0 = non-smoker.}
\item{age_group}{Age group: "40-54", "55-69", or "70+".}
\item{sex}{Sex: "Male" or "Female".}

\description{
A simulated dataset from a case-control study examining the association
between smoking and lung cancer, stratified by age group and sex.
}
\details{
The data were simulated with a true odds ratio of approximately 3 for the
association between smoking and lung cancer. Smoking prevalence varies by
age group and sex, and the case probability increases with age.
