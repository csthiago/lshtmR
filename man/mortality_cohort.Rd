\title{Simulated Cohort Study Data for Mortality}
\format{
A data frame with 600 rows and 6 variables:
\describe{
\item{id}{Unique participant identifier.}
\item{death}{Death outcome: 1 = died during follow-up, 0 = survived.}
\item{treatment}{Treatment exposure: 1 = treated, 0 = untreated.}
\item{person_years}{Follow-up time in person-years.}
\item{severity}{Disease severity: "Mild", "Moderate", or "Severe".}
\item{age_cat}{Age category: "Young", "Middle", or "Old".}
}
}
\source{
Simulated data for educational purposes.

\usage{
mortality_cohort
}
\description{
A simulated dataset from a cohort study examining the effect of a treatment
on mortality, stratified by disease severity and age category.
}
\details{
The data were simulated with a true incidence rate ratio of approximately 0.6
for the protective effect of treatment on mortality. Mortality rates increase
with disease severity and age, and treatment probability decreases with
severity.

# Calculate stratified rate ratio by severity

# Calculate stratified rate ratio by age category
