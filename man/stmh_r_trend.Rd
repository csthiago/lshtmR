\usage{
stmh_r_trend(
  data,
  event,
  exposure,
  time,
  strata = NULL,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{event}{Name of event variable.}

\item{exposure}{Name of numeric exposure variable.}

\item{time}{Name of person-time variable.}

\item{strata}{Name of stratification variable(s). When provided, computes
u and v within each stratum, then sums across strata for the pooled estimate.
A test of homogeneity is also performed.}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level.}
}
\value{
A list with trend test results.
}
\description{
Calculates a score test for trend in rates across ordered exposure levels.
This is called internally by stmh_r when the exposure has more than 2 levels.
Matches Stata's stmh command exactly.
